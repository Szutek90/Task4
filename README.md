# Handling numbers in lists

The project involves the implementation of the List class, which processes data contained in a text file. This file contains lines, each of which contains three integers separated by a semicolon, e.g.: 32;56;10. The List class stores this data in three separate lists: the smallest, average, and largest numbers from each row. Furthermore, the class offers various methods for analyzing and processing this data
